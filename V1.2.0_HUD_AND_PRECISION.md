# ?? v1.2.0 - HUD & PRECISION AIMING!

## ? NEW FEATURES!

### 1. **Real-Time HUD Display** ??
Shows in top-left corner every 0.5 seconds:
- **MAG: 250/1000** - Current rounds in magazine / Total capacity
- **AMMO: 500** - Remaining bolts in inventory  
- **RANGE: 45m** - Distance to target where crosshair is pointing

### 2. **Precision Raycast Aiming** ??
- Bolts now hit EXACTLY where the crosshair points!
- Uses Physics.Raycast to calculate perfect trajectory
- Works at any range (up to 500m)
- Accounts for distance and angle automatically

### 3. **Smart Ammo Counting** ??
- Counts all bolts in your inventory
- Works with any ammo type
- Updates in real-time as you fire
- Shows when you're running low

---

## ?? **What You'll See**

### HUD Display Example:
```
MAG: 250/1000 | AMMO: 500 | RANGE: 45m
```

When reloading:
```
RELOADING...
```

### How It Works:

**Before (v1.1.0):**
- Bolts fired in camera direction
- No info about ammo or distance
- Trajectory was approximate

**After (v1.2.0):**
- Raycast determines exact hit point
- Bolts aimed at that exact point
- Real-time HUD shows all info
- Perfect accuracy at any range!

---

## ?? **Technical Details**

### Raycast Aiming System:
```csharp
1. Cast ray from camera forward
2. Find hit point (terrain, enemy, object)
3. Calculate direction from spawn point to hit point
4. Fire projectile in that exact direction
5. Result: Bolt hits exactly where you're aiming!
```

### Benefits:
- ? Sniper-level accuracy
- ? Works with zoom
- ? Predictable trajectory
- ? No more guessing drop compensation
- ? Perfect for NoGravity mode

---

## ?? **Recommended Sniper Config**

For maximum precision:
```ini
[General]
Enabled = true
DamageMultiplier = 300.0    # High damage
FireRate = 2.0              # Slow, deliberate

[Zoom]
ZoomMin = 5.0
ZoomMax = 20.0              # 20x zoom for long range

[Projectile]
Velocity = 400.0            # Very fast travel
NoGravity = true            # Laser straight!

[Magazine]
Capacity = 20               # Limited ammo, make shots count
```

This setup with raycast aiming = **Perfect sniper rifle!**

---

## ?? **Testing the HUD**

### 1. Spawn and Equip Ripper
```
spawn Ripper 1
```

### 2. Look Around
- Point at nearby object ? HUD shows distance (e.g., "10m")
- Point at distant terrain ? HUD shows farther (e.g., "150m")
- Point at sky ? HUD shows "---" (no hit)

### 3. Fire and Watch
- HUD updates magazine count
- "MAG: 999/1000" ? "MAG: 998/1000" ? etc.
- When empty ? "RELOADING..."
- After 2 seconds ? "MAG: 1000/1000 | AMMO: ..."

### 4. Test Precision
- Enable NoGravity for easy testing
- Aim at distant target
- Fire - bolt should hit exactly where crosshair points!

---

## ?? **HUD Update Frequency**

- Updates every **0.5 seconds**
- Doesn't spam messages
- Shows during active crossbow use
- Hides when weapon switched

---

## ?? **Accuracy Comparison**

### Without Raycast (v1.1.0):
```
Aim at target 100m away
? Bolt goes in camera direction
? May hit target, may miss
? Unpredictable at distance
```

### With Raycast (v1.2.0):
```
Aim at target 100m away
? Raycast finds exact hit point
? Bolt aimed at that point
? Hits target perfectly!
```

---

## ?? **Use Cases**

### Close Range (0-50m):
- HUD shows precise distance
- Instant hit with high velocity
- Machine gun mode works great

### Medium Range (50-150m):
- Zoom in for better view
- HUD helps judge distance
- NoGravity recommended

### Long Range (150m+):
- Max zoom (20x)
- NoGravity essential
- High velocity for fast travel
- Raycast ensures accuracy

---

## ?? **Troubleshooting**

### HUD Not Showing?
1. Make sure you have crossbow equipped
2. Check mod is enabled
3. HUD updates every 0.5s - wait a moment
4. Try firing - updates on shot

### Distance Shows "---"?
- You're aiming at sky/nothing
- Try aiming at ground or object
- Raycast range is 500m max

### Ammo Count Wrong?
- Make sure bolts are in inventory
- Works with items containing "bolt" in name
- Check ammo type matches weapon

### Bolts Missing Target?
- This should be fixed with raycast!
- Try NoGravity = true
- Increase Velocity for faster travel
- Make sure target is within 500m

---

## ?? **Quick Test**

```
1. spawn Ripper 1
2. Equip Ripper
3. Look at ground nearby
4. HUD should show: "MAG: 1000/1000 | AMMO: 0 | RANGE: 5m" (or similar)
5. Hold left mouse - rapid fire!
6. Watch magazine count down
7. Aim at different distances - range updates
8. Empty magazine - see "RELOADING..."
9. After 2 sec - back to full!
```
