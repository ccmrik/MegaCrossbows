## ?? **How It Works Now:**

### **Firing Behavior:**
```
1. HOLD left mouse ? Rapid fire starts
2. Magazine counts down: 1000 ? 999 ? 998 ? ...
3. Keep firing continuously!
4. Magazine hits 0 ? "Reloading..." appears
5. Wait 2 seconds (keep holding mouse if you want)
6. "Reloaded! (1000 rounds)" ? Firing resumes automatically!
```

**Key Point:** You can hold the fire button through the entire reload!

### **Zoom Behavior:**
```
1. HOLD right mouse ? Zoom activates
2. Scroll wheel ? Adjust zoom level (2x to 10x)
3. Zoom stays on as long as you hold right mouse
4. Release right mouse ? Zoom off
```

**Key Point:** Smooth, predictable zoom control!

6. Still holding - after 2 sec, firing resumes!
7. Never need to release the button!
```

## ?? **Recommended Configs:**

### **Sustained Fire Config:**
```ini
[General]
FireRate = 10.0             # 10 shots/second
DamageMultiplier = 100.0

[Zoom]
ZoomMin = 2.0
ZoomMax = 10.0

[Projectile]
Velocity = 200.0            # Fast bolts
NoGravity = true            # No drop

[Magazine]
Capacity = 5000             # Long sustained fire!
```

**Perfect for suppressive fire!**

### **Precision Sniper Config:**
```ini
[General]
FireRate = 1.0              # 1 shot/second (deliberate)
DamageMultiplier = 500.0    # High damage

[Zoom]
ZoomMin = 5.0               # Start higher
ZoomMax = 20.0              # 20x max zoom!

[Projectile]
Velocity = 400.0            # Very fast
NoGravity = true            # Laser straight

[Magazine]
Capacity = 20               # Limited ammo
```

**Perfect for long-range precision!**
